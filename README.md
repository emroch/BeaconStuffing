# Embedding Data in 802.11 Beacons for Covert Communication

This paper discusses the feasibility of using 802.11 beacons to communicate over a network for the purposes of covert communication, low-overhead data transfer, and non-associative broadcast.  Source code for a proof-of-concept is provided in the `src` folder.  Please see `src/README.md` for installation and setup instructions.
